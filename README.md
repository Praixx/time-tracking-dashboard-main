## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
= Javascript



### What I learned

i had so much fun working on this because i was able to learn more about asyncronous javascript and working with externaml json file. i was also able to impliment the keyup or the key down funtion to change the controls and give you the data from each selected controls. i also learnt more about using conditional iteration. and i was also able to make the code as efficient as possible and also tried to fix any bug that could occur from when the user is using it.
